It helps share knowledge and ownership among developers. Doing code review also helps reduce bugs and ensure a consistent codebase for long-term maintainability. Please see our Code Review Guidelines for more details.</p> <p>A comprehensive guide on providing good code review is available at Google's Engineering Practices documentation.</p> <p>The following principles taken from the above guide are especially important to follow:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Fast response time</p> <p>The code review process is meant to improve the quality of new code. However, if the process becomes too frustrating to developers, it can have the opposite effect by becoming an obstacle against making valuable changes.</p> <p>The total code review process can be as fast or as slow as needed, but the delay between each reply should be as short as possible. It should take a day (or at most a few days) to submit your first comments, and the participants should reply to new commits or messages as soon as possible (but without interrupting focused work).</p> <p>A fast response time is important because \"most complaints about the code review process are actually resolved by making the process faster\", and since \"slow reviews also discourage code cleanups, refactorings, and further improvements\".</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved quality</p> <p>Code review involves using time and effort to improve the quality of new code, but also requires choosing a stopping point at which to integrate changes into the project and ensure forward progress.</p> <p>You must balance between your responsibility to ensure good code quality, and the need to allow developers to make progress. Don't allow code to be integrated that reduces the overall quality of the system (unless in an emergency). That being said, code review must end at some point. A good rule of thumb is that \"reviewers should favor approving a CL [changelist] once it is in a state where it definitely improves the overall code health of the system being worked on, even if the CL isn\u2019t perfect.</p> </li> <li> <p>Giving clear expectations</p> <p>Clear communication helps code reviews to go more smoothly and be more effective. Here are some examples of things that should be communicated:</p> <ul> <li>If you're holding off on approving changes until something specific is done, let the author know so you aren't both left in an uncertain waiting state.</li> <li>Identify any suggestions that you want to leave up to the developer to accept or ignore (take it or leave it) and for which you don't expect follow-up.     These are suggestions that the author can ignore if they choose to.</li> <li>You can identify small detail changes, often style-related, as \"nit:\" (representing a nit-pick).</li> <li>Let the author know if you were only able to review one aspect of a changelist.     For example, if you reviewed database changes but someone else needs to review the security aspect of those changes, let the author know.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"development/best_practices/best_practices/#branching-style","title":"Branching style","text":"<p>A very common branching model is git flow (main, develop, feature and hotfix branches). Very popular is also GitHub Flow (main and feature/hotfix branches) which treats main as always deployable.</p> <p>Git Flow has additional complexity which is worth it in some cases (see Workflows Comparison: Git Flow Vs GitHub Flow).</p> <p>GitLab Flow is a simpler version of Git Flow.</p> <p>Proposal: Start with the simple model (GitHub Flow) and see if that is sufficient.

Example: System Context diagram for Financial Risk System</li> <li>Layout</li> <li>Visual consistency: Try to be consistent with notation and element positioning across diagrams (same colour codings and shapes)</li> <li>Acronyms: Be wary of using acronyms, especially those related to the business/domain that you work in (focus more on domain-specific/business-specific acronyms)</li> <li>Elements: Start with simple boxes containing the element name, type, technology (if appropriate) and a description/responsibilities</li> <li>Lines: Favour uni-directional lines showing the most important dependencies or data flow, with an annotation to be explicit about the purpose of the line and direction<ul> <li>Summarize the intent of the relationship (SPA \"makes API calls using\" API application)</li> <li>Summarize, yet be specific (\"Makes API calls using\" vs. \"Uses\")</li> <li>Show both directions when the intents are different</li> <li>Beware of hiding the true story: \"Sends customer update messages to [via Kafka topic X]\"</li> <li>Add more words to make the intent explicit (\"Sends trade data to\" vs. \"trade data\")</li> </ul> </li> <li>Key/Legend: Explain shapes, line styles, colours, borders, acronyms etc. (even if your notation seems obvious)</li> <li>Use shape, colour and size to complement a diagram that already makes sense</li> <li>Use icons to supplement text, not replace it (additional layer of information)</li> <li>Increase the readability of software architecture diagrams, so they can stand alone</li> <li>Tell stories: Any narrative (on top of the

# OpenEMR: Adding a new patient

This document does not provide full OpenEMR instructions for creating and adding a patient. It is intended for clinics or health systems integrating with the Opal application, with the minimal OpenEMR requirements for this integration.

If you need more information about the OpenEMR system and its complete set of features, please refer to this link: [https://www.open-emr.org/](https://www.open-emr.org/)

The purpose of this document is to show the steps for adding a new patient to the OpenEMR system, that will be registered and use Opal. This document is intended for the Hospital front desk staff.

1. Access OpenEMR and log in.

1. A **Calendar** section will appear. A list of **Providers** will be located on the left of the screen. By clicking on a specific name of the list, you can see the provider's calendar and their scheduled appointments.

1. You can choose to view the provider's calendar by Day, Week or Month, by clicking on one of the appropriate blue buttons on the top right of the screen. You can also print your calendar (daily, weekly or monthly), by clicking on the blue "printer‚Äù icon located at the top right of the screen.

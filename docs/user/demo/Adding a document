# Adding a document in OpenEMR

*This document is NOT a fully OpenEMR implementation. It is specifically intended for clinics or health systems implementing the Opal application. It contains the necessary OpenEMR requirements for implementing the Opal application.

If you need more information about the OpenEMR system and its complete set of features, please refer to this link: [https://www.open-emr.org/](https://www.open-emr.org/)

The purpose of this document is to show the steps for adding a new document, for example a clinical note, to the OpenEMR system, with the objective of a patient or their caregiver being able to view it in their Opal account. This document is intended for the Hospital front desk staff.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have an up to date [installation of Opal](setup.md#set-up-a-local-development-environment) on your machine, and that you understand the context of the code you intend to work on with respect to the [high-level architecture of the opal solution](architecture/index.md#high-level-architecture).
Due to the history of Opal and its cross-domain functionality, there are many different frameworks and languages used in our tech stack that can be contributed to, including Python, Django, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Mirth Connect, SQL Alchemy, and more.

## How to Contribute

Opal uses GitLab as a central hub for both documentation and source code.

TODO: What link do we want to provide as the 'central' hub of the open source project? Will it even be gitlab?
The main collection of repositories [can be found here.](https://gitlab.com/opalmedapps)

As a general rule of thumb for all types of contributions, be sure to search the pertitent repository for existing issues/feature requests before creating a new one.
In most cases, an OHIG developer or maintainer must review and approve change requests before they can be merged into the main project branch of a repository.

When submitting a change that resolves an issue or feature request, be sure to provide a clear and descriptive title, following the [Convential Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
Following this specification has the advantages of:

* communicating the nature of changes to others
* allowing tooling to automatically generate version bumps
* allowing tooling to automatically generate CHANGELOG updates

<!-- Please do not force push to your PR's branch after you have created your PR, as doing so forces us to review the whole PR again. This makes it harder for us to review your work because we don't know what has changed. -->
<!-- PRs will always be squashed by us when we merge your work. Commit as many times as you need in this branch. -->

You can also read more about general contribution instructions in the [Opal backend documentation](https://opalmedapps.gitlab.io/backend/#contributing).

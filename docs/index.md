# Opal Documentation

## Try it Yourself

If you'd like to get a feel for the experience of using Opal as a patient, try it yourself by logging into a test account in our demo hospitals.

1. Download the `Opal - Patient in the loop` app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hig.opal2)
    or [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/opal-patient-in-the-loop/id1446920350).
1. Launch the app, and log in with a test account[^1].
    Under the password field, you'll be prompted to choose a hospital: Select `Opal Demo 1`.
1. Take a look around the app, and feel free to try out all the features (including answering questionnaires, checking into appointments, etc.).

!!! info

    Due to the app's security settings, each account only allows one concurrent login.
    If another user logs into the account you're using, you'll be logged out with the message "You have logged in on another device".
    The number of available test accounts will be adjusted according to demand; to report an issue, please contact us at `___`.

[^1]: We will add test account credentials to this page soon.

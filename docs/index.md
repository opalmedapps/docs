# Opal Documentation

!!! tip "Open Source"

    We've just gone open source!
    This site is currently under construction while we add more details and information to support our open source community.
    New information will be added regularly. Please check back for updates.
    To report an issue with this site, please email us at `___`.

This is the home page for Opal's technical documentation,
where we've grouped together information on setup, deployment, architecture, and open-source contribution to the Opal code base.

Opal is an award-winning open source patient-in-the-loop data platform, connecting patients, clinicians, industry partners and researchers.
Opal provides real-time access for patients to their medical data, through a host of features,
such as appointments, lab results, clinical notes, personalized educational and reference materials,
questionnaires, connection to smart devices, on-site appointment check-in and call-in, e-consent, data donation, etc.
Opal is constantly evolvingâ€”refer to our contribution guide for more information on how you can contribute to Opal's development.

## Try it Yourself

If you'd like to get a feel for the experience of using Opal as a patient, try it yourself by logging into a test account in one of our demo hospitals.

1. Download the `Opal - Patient in the loop` app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hig.opal2)
    or [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/opal-patient-in-the-loop/id1446920350).
1. Launch the app, and log in using one of the following test accounts: `___`.
    Under the password field, you'll be prompted to choose a hospital; select `Opal Demo 1`.
1. Take a look around the app, and feel free to try out all the features (including answering questionnaires, checking into appointments, etc.).
    All data is reset automatically at the end of `___<every night/week/month>___`.

!!! info

    Due to the app's security settings, each account only allows one concurrent login.
    If another user logs into the account you're using, you'll be logged out with the message "You have logged in on another device".
    The number of available test accounts will be adjusted according to demand; to report an issue, please contact us at `___`.
